pick one of the memcpy implementations or add a file containing a memcpy function called

`mymemcpy`.

it needs to be called this way in order to keep optimizations/system libc from
interfering.

then run
`CC=gcc OPTS="-O3 -funroll-all-loops" ./compare.py impl1.c [impl2.s ... implX.c]`

(both .s and .c suffixes are supported)

if you use a modern CPU using speedstep, you can get much better results by
putting the CPU into "userspace" governor and then lock the CPU freq to 1 GHz.
