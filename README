pick one of the memcpy implementations or add a file containing a memcpy function called 

'mymemcpy'

run ./build.sh name_of_file_providing_mymemcpy_func.c
./test | tee descriptive_log_filename_here.txt

do the same with a second impl

when you have 2 files with different results you can compare them using

./compare.pl file1 file2
